# kcat
Like *nix cat but consuming from Apache Kafka.

## Prerequisites
* [Snappy compression library](https://github.com/google/snappy)

## Build
On Mac OS X it seems that Rust doesn't have /usr/local/lib in its linker search path(s). In general its not recommended to put things like _/usr/local/lib_ which likely contain homebrew compiled libs in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is because they might conflict with Mac's native libs. So export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH instead like so:

```
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

kcat's build script (build.rs) picks this up if available and adds it to the link search path(s).

Assuming did everything above you should just be able to:

```
cargo build
```

### Cross-compiling
Use Rustup. [https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/13/rustup.html](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/05/13/rustup.html)

## Usage
